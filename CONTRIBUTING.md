Contributing guidelines
=======================

## How do I report a problem?

[Submit an issue](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow/issues) for each problem. Please keep in mind the people who make open source software are volunteers.

1. **Describe your problem**, sometimes there are different solutions.
2. **Add a lot of details**, the more we know the better we can help.
3. **Complain with kindness**, consider working together with us.
